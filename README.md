# "Who's That Pokemon?" Game
This repo contains a Pokemon guessing game made in Week 2 of my [School of Code](https://www.schoolofcode.co.uk/) bootcamp (May 2022).

## Context

In Week 2 of School of Code, we learned about **HTML DOM manipulation** and the **Fetch API**. Our one-day hackathon at the end of the week tasked us with using this knowledge to make an interesting app utilizing the API of our choice.

My partner and I selected the well-known [Poke API](https://pokeapi.co/) and ideated a "Who's That Pokemon?" Game, where the player could view a silhouette of a random pokemon and guess their name. The app also includes an easter egg that displays a joke from this [Dad Joke API](https://icanhazdadjoke.com/api) when you click in the right place (spoilers in the code).

I was really pleased with the resulting app, which is simple in design, but fun and operational. During this process, I learned a lot more about using asynchronous functions, fetch requests, and manipulating the DOM in various ways (creating and updating elements, event listeners, etc).

This game can be played by opening the corresponding 'index.html' file in a browser.
